Task 4: Customer Segmentation Visualization

📌 Objective

The objective of this task is to segment customers based on their tenure and visualize key patterns in customer distribution and spending behavior. This helps in understanding how customer loyalty (tenure) relates to monthly charges.


---

📊 Dataset

The dataset contains customer information including:

tenure: Number of months the customer has stayed with the company

MonthlyCharges: Monthly amount charged to the customer



---

🛠️ Tools & Libraries Used

Python

Pandas

Matplotlib

🔹 Steps Performed

1️⃣ Customer Segmentation Based on Tenure

Customers were grouped into three tenure categories:

0–12 months

13–36 months

37+ months


A new column TenureGroup was created to represent these segments.


---

2️⃣ Customer Distribution Visualization

A donut chart was created to visualize the proportion of customers in each tenure group. This helps in understanding how customers are distributed across different tenure ranges.


---

3️⃣ Average Monthly Charges Analysis

The average monthly charges were calculated for each tenure group and visualized using a bar chart. This comparison shows how spending behavior varies across different customer segments.


---

4️⃣ Highlighting Key Trends Using Annotations

Annotations were added to the bar chart to highlight significant trends, such as the tenure group with the highest average monthly charges. This makes insights clearer and more interpretable.


---

📈 Key Insights

Customers are unevenly distributed across tenure groups.

Longer-tenure customers tend to show different spending patterns compared to newer customers.

Visual annotations help quickly identify important trends.



---

✅ Conclusion

This task successfully demonstrates customer segmentation using tenure and effective data visualization techniques to analyze customer distribution and spending behavior.
